# Optimization of Freeskate Motion

This repository contains the code for my final project for MATH164: Scientific Computing. 

Freeline skating (also known as freeskating) is a form of skating where each foot stands on an independent skate, allowing a greater degree of freedom in the rider's motion. Instead of pushing off the ground to gain speed like with a skateboard, riders perform an action known as "pumping," where the skates are oppositely pushed away from and pulled back towards the body. The action involves an outward and inward force exerted by the legs and a clockwise and counterclockwise torque exerted by the ankles. This project utilizes a simplified simulation to investigate the optimal force patterns in terms of square waves and aims to recreate the pumping motion through optimization.
